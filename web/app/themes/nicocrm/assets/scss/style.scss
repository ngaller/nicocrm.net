Stylesheet: Main Stylesheet

Here's where the magic happens. Here, you'll see we are calling in
the separate media queries. The base mobile goes outside any query
and is called at the beginning, after that we call the rest
of the styles inside media queries.

The organization of the stylesheets in this site are inspired from the
article by Harry Roberts "Modern CSS Architecture and Front-End Development"
(Smashing Book #4)

IMPORTING MODULES
Modules are reusable blocks or elements we use throughout the project.
We can break them up as much as we want or just keep them all in one.
I mean, you can do whatever you want. The world is your oyster. Unless
you hate oysters, then the world is your peanut butter & jelly sandwich.

// alert boxes
@import "modules/alerts";

// buttons
@import "modules/buttons";

 MEDIA QUERIES
 Styles below are specific to a certain size or media.
 The base styles (included above) are for the mobile.
 (not sure we need this because I would rather have the media specific stuff inside of each style!)
*********************/
//
//LARGER MOBILE DEVICES
//This is for devices like the Galaxy Note or something that's
//larger than an iPhone but smaller than a tablet. Let's call them
//tweeners.
//*********************/
//@media only screen and (min-width: $phone) {
//
//	// styles in 481up.scss
//	@import "breakpoints/481up";
//
//} // end of media query
//
///*********************
//TABLET & SMALLER LAPTOPS
//This is the average viewing window. So Desktops, Laptops, and
//in general anyone not viewing on a mobile device. Here's where
//you can add resource intensive styles.
//*********************/
//@media only screen and (min-width: $tablet) {
//
//	// styles in 768up.scss
//	@import "breakpoints/768up";
//
//} // end of media query
//
///*********************
//DESKTOP
//This is the average viewing window. So Desktops, Laptops, and
//in general anyone not viewing on a mobile device. Here's where
//you can add resource intensive styles.
//*********************/
//@media only screen and (min-width: $desktop) {
//
//	// styles in 1030up.scss
//	@import "breakpoints/1030up";
//
//} // end of media query
//
///*********************
//LARGE VIEWING SIZE
//This is for the larger monitors and possibly full screen viewers.
//*********************/
//@media only screen and (min-width: $large-desktop) {
//
//	// styles in 1240up.scss
//	@import "breakpoints/1240up";
//
//} // end of media query

/*********************
RETINA (2x RESOLUTION DEVICES)
This applies to the retina iPhone (4s) and iPad (2,3) along with
other displays with a 2x resolution. You can also create a media
query for retina AND a certain size if you want. Go Nuts.
*********************/
@media only screen and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5),
       only screen and (min--moz-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5),
       only screen and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5) {

	// styles in 2x.scss
	@import "media/2x";

} // end of media query

/*********************
PRINT STYLESHEET
Feel free to customize this. Remember to add things that won't make
sense to print at the bottom. Things like nav, ads, and forms should
be set to display none.
*********************/
@media print {

	// styles in print.scss
	@import "media/print";

}
